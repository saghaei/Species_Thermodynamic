# Thermodynamic Properties of Species

By using this library you can calculate the thermodynamic properties of individual species using NASA 7 term polynomials. It's a simple code and has been coded by standard libraries, just add the library to your program and by defining Thermo objects for each species you can have access to its thermodynamic properties.
This library uses CHEMKIN-II format and the default database is GRI-Mech version 3.0, if you need other species, just replace the database file.
